#### Software Requirements for the Workshop:
We will be using Python data stack for the workshop. Please install Ananconda for Python 3.5 for the workshop. That has everything we need for the workshop. 

For attendees more curious, we will be using Jupyter Notebook as our IDE. We will be introducing numpy, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodel and scikit-learn.
